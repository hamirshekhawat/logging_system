Given a continuous stream of logs in a text file, come up with an alerting system which based on a alerting configuration sends alerts on different channels.

Supported channels
1. SMS
2. Email
3. PN

Example configuration
WARN:
  threshold: 5
  wait_time: 5m
  measurment_window: 1m
  notification_channels:
    - EMAIL
  notifiable_users:
    -  user1
    -  user2
ERROR:
  threshold: 2
  wait_time: 2m
  measurement_window: 30s
  notification_channels:
    - PN
    - SMS
  notifiable_users:
    - user3
    - user4


Example Input file
Type|time_in_seconds|log
WARN 00:00  log1
WARN 00:01  log2
WARN 00:03  log3
ERROR 00:04 log4
WARN 00:05 log5
ERROR 00:06 log7
WARN 00:07 log8
ERROR 00:08 log9
ERORR 00:09 log10

Configuration logic:
for all logs of type WARN if there are 5 occurrences within 1m time interval, the system will notify users user1, user2 on email.
After notifying the users, the system has to wait for 5m until measuring again for subsequent notifications.

Similarly for all logs of type ERROR if there are 2 occurrences within 1m time interval, the system will notify users user3, user4 on PN, SMS.

With the above example input file, we see that at 00:06 second, we get 2 occurrences of logs of type error within the 1m time measurement window assuming that
we start measuring from 00:00. Hence at 00:06s the system has to send out notifications. Similarly at 00:07 we have got 5 occurrences of logs of type WARN, hence another
notification has to be triggered.

Once the notification for ERROR has gone out at 00:06s we have to wait until 02:06s, until we start measuring again. i.e, between 00:06s and 02:06s no matter how many occurrences
of ERROR comes, it has to be ignored.

 Tips:
 1. You can just log to std out saying that sending notification to users on sms or something for the sake of proving the solution to be correct, you need not
 send the notification on a real communication medium
 2. Use proper design patterns where ever necessary
 3. System should be flexible enough to handle more log types and communication channels
